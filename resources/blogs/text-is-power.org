* Intro
** Problem
- Time is wasted using tools to write documentation
- The documentation people write is difficult to 
  - search
  - modify
  - track
** Solution
Stop using bulky tools to write your documentation and just write in plain text
* What Do You Mean?
** Let Me Explain                                                 :slideshow:
- Don't Use
  - Visio
  - Confluence
  - Powerpoint
- Do Use
  - Your favorite text editor
** Let Me Explain                                                  :blog:
Instead of using tools such as Visio, Confluence, and Powerpoint we can simply 
write our documentation in a text file and then run a program to generate the 
documents that we are after
* Diagrams
** Problem
- People take pictures of whiteboards
- Images are very difficult to search
- Images are very difficult to edit
- No one wants your email of that photo you took
** Problem                                                         :blog:
All too often I have seen people taking photos of whiteboard trying to capture
and document a diagram or graph that was written during a design discussion.
** Solution
- Write your diagrams in plain text using [[https://www.uml.org/what-is-uml.htm][UML]]
- Generate image using [[http://plantuml.com/][PlantUML]]
** Example
- 
  #+BEGIN_VERSE
  @startuml
  [one] --> [two]
  [two] --> [three]
  @enduml
  #+END_VERSE
- [[file:../diagrams/test.png]]
** Note                                                                :blog:
PlantUML supports many different types of diagrams and graphs. This is just a 
very simple example of what it can do.
* Presentations
** Problem :slideshow:
- People spend far too much time creating presentations
- Presentations often look the same due to branding
** Problem                                                             :blog:
I have seen coworkers spend half a day or more (I've seen up to a week) working on a presentation
for a meeting that is coming up. This is simply too much time. This is all content that the person
knows. They are end up stressing about trying to make a nice presentation and waste valuable time.
** Solution
- Open up that editor and jot your notes in your preferred markup language
- Use [[https://pandoc.org/][Pandoc]] to import your file and export a [[https://github.com/hakimel/reveal.js/][Reveal.js]] file
** Example
- [[file:../text-is-power.org][this]]
- This presentation was generated
* But what does that really get us?
** Searching
- grep
** Version Control
- git
** Easy Maintenance
- Any Editor
** Automation
- Parse
- Convert
* Documentation DevOps
** DevOps isn't just for code
- Deploy documentation artifacts
- Build of check in using a pipeline
- Push files to third parties on update
